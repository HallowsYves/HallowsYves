# Whats up! I'm Yves 

## ✩ ABOUT ME ✩
I'm a Computer Science major with a concentration in Cybersecurity, currently a junior at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). I have a strong passion for security, privacy, and protecting systems from vulnerabilities. I enjoy exploring different aspects of cybersecurity, from penetration testing to secure coding and cryptography.

Outside of computer science, I also make music! 🎵 you can check it out [here!](https://www.youtube.com/@pronouncedkez)
